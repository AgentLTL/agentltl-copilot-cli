## The `agentltl` command

The steps below run `agentltl`. If it is not on the PATH, it is in the plugin folder:
`"${COPILOT_HOME:-$HOME/.copilot}"/installed-plugins/agentltl/agentltl/bin/agentltl` (from a
direct install: `installed-plugins/_direct/agentltl*/bin/agentltl`). Use that path in its
place, and offer the user `agentltl install-cli`, which links it into `~/.local/bin`.

Report on the AgentLTL for Copilot CLI. Requested: what the user asked for (nothing more specific means `status`).

- **status**:
  1. Run `agentltl validate`, then `agentltl trace`.
  2. Summarise in a few lines:
     - which rules are in force, and their modes;
     - how many calls are recorded;
     - the recent interventions, and why.
  3. If the rule file has errors, show them first. Until they are fixed, nothing is enforced.
- **trace**: run `agentltl trace` and show the output.
- **reset**:
  1. Confirm with the user first, because it forgets which calls already happened. For example,
     tests already run will no longer count toward `before` rules.
  2. Then run `agentltl reset`.
- **check <steps>**: run `agentltl check <steps>` and explain each outcome.

To pick packaged rules, use the `/agentltl-setup` skill. To add, change or remove rules, use
the `/agentltl-rules` skill.
