# Choosing packaged rules

## The `agentltl` command

The steps below run `agentltl`. If it is not on the PATH, it is in the plugin folder:
`"${COPILOT_HOME:-$HOME/.copilot}"/installed-plugins/agentltl/agentltl/bin/agentltl` (from a
direct install: `installed-plugins/_direct/agentltl*/bin/agentltl`). Use that path in its
place, and offer the user `agentltl install-cli`, which links it into `~/.local/bin`.

The plugin ships a library of tested rules. Switching one on adds its name to the `use:` list
of `AGENTLTL.yaml`; the rule itself stays in the plugin and gets fixes with plugin updates.
`--user` (the user asked for rules everywhere) means rules for every project, in
`~/.copilot/AGENTLTL.yaml`.

## Steps

1. **List the library**: run `agentltl library --json`. Each entry has a `name`, a `summary`,
   `tags`, `in_use` (already on in a file that applies here) and its rule ids.

2. **Ask where the rules go**, unless `--user` was given: this project (`AGENTLTL.yaml` at the
   project root) or every project (`~/.copilot/AGENTLTL.yaml`). Rules for one repository's
   workflow (tests, deploys) usually belong to the project; personal habits (no Copilot
   co-author) to every project.

3. **Let the user choose.** Ask the user, with the ask_user tool if you have it, a few
   entries at a time.
   - Group the entries by theme using their tags, for example "Git safety", "Files and
     secrets", or "Workflow and cost".
   - Show each entry's `name` and its `summary`.
   - Offer a bundle (an entry tagged `bundle`, such as `devops-secrets`) as one choice that
     switches on all the entries it lists.
   - Mark entries already on with "(on)". Tell the user that unticking one switches it off.
   - Without a tool for choices, show a numbered list and ask for the numbers.

4. **Ask about strictness** only if the user wants it. Every entry has a sensible default
   mode. To change it, use `agentltl use NAME --mode warn`. The modes are block, warn, ask,
   retry, stop and log; see the `/agentltl-rules` skill's reference.md.

5. **Apply the choices**, adding `--user` for every project:
   - `agentltl use NAME...` for the newly ticked entries;
   - `agentltl unuse NAME...` for the ones the user unticked.

   These commands edit only the `use:` list and keep the rest of the file. They create the file
   if it is missing.

6. **Check the result**: run `agentltl validate`. Then show the user the rules now in force,
   with each rule's mode and one line on what it does.
   - If a chosen rule depends on the project, say so. For example, `tests-before-push` knows
     common test runners (pytest, npm test, cargo test, make test...). If the project tests
     differently, offer to write a project rule with the same id: it replaces the packaged one.
   - `agentltl library NAME` shows a rule's YAML in full.

7. **Offer to scan memory**: run `agentltl memory scan --json`. If its
   `counts.candidates` is above 0, offer "Scan custom instructions for rules
   (N statements in M files)". If the user accepts, follow
   [the import skill](../agentltl-import/SKILL.md) from its step 2, reusing
   that scan. Instructions already in memory then become rules that are enforced.

8. **Offer the status line**, once per machine, saying it is experimental in Copilot CLI:
   `AgentLTL ● 4 rules · 2 block · 1 ask · 1 warn`. Check `~/.copilot/settings.json`:
   - It has no `statusLine`: ask "Show AgentLTL and the number of rules in force in the
     status line (an experimental Copilot CLI feature)?" If yes, run
     `agentltl statusline --install`. It sets `statusLine` and switches on the `STATUS_LINE`
     feature flag, and changes nothing else.
   - It already shows AgentLTL: say so and skip this step.
   - It has another status line: don't replace it. Show the line the install prints, which
     adds AgentLTL's line to the user's own script, and replace it with `--force` only if
     the user asks.

   The line appears in the next Copilot CLI session.

9. **Offer custom rules**: for anything the library and memory don't cover, use the
   `/agentltl-rules` skill to write a rule from the user's own words.

Changes apply from the next tool call. No restart is needed.
